# Cosmo Extension

This extension allows you to interact with Cosmo directly from your browser.

## Installation

1. **Download:** Get the `extension.zip` file.
2. **Unpack:** Extract the contents of the `extension.zip` file to a folder on your computer.
3. **Token Setup:**
    - Open the `content.js` file (located within the extracted folder) in a text or code editor.
    - Find line 2 that looks like this: `let alphaToken = '';`
    - Place the token given to you inside the empty quotes `''`. **Do not share this token with anyone.**  It should look something like this: `let alphaToken = 'your_actual_token_here';`
    - Save the `content.js` file.
4. **Open Chrome Extensions:** In your Google Chrome browser, go to `chrome://extensions`.
5. **Enable Developer Mode:** In the top-right corner of the extensions page, toggle the "Developer mode" switch to the ON position.
6. **Load Unpacked:** Click the "Load unpacked" button in the top-left corner.
7. **Select Folder:** Choose the folder you unpacked in step 2.
8. **Done!** The Cosmo extension is now installed in Chrome.
